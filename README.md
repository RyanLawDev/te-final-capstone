# Tech Elevator Final Capstone - Fan-Band Connector
â€‹
This was my final project for my 14-week bootcamp at Tech Elevator. I was on a team with 4 other developers and we created an application that allows fans to connect with and discover bands.
This is a full stack application. I used a postgreSQL database with a Java back-end. A RESTful API communicates with a web front-end that uses HTML, CSS, and the Javascript framework Vue. Spotify and MusicBrainz APIs were called on the front-end to retieve data for all of the bands on Spotify.
